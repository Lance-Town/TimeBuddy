# TimeBuddy
This program will allow you to keep track of how much time you spend on all of your college courses.

I wrote this program during the first semester of my freshman year of college, and I wanted a small progect that I could do to learn C++ classes and linked lists.
I settled on this program as it sounded fun to track how much time I studied during the semester.

# Data structure used
- Linked list that I made as the main data structure to hold the values that were taken from the CSV file containing the courses I am taking, 
and the time spent studying in each class. 

# What I learned or improved
- Became much more familiar with linked lists and how to use them when reading input of unknown length from files
- Improved my file handling skills in C++
- Became more familiar with classes in C++ and OOP
- Got better at splitting up my files instead of having one monstorous main :)
